# Multi-Agent Supervisor Chatting with a User

A scenario was designed where agents interact with users to gather information or request approval. To enable seamless communication, an additional node called "Human" was introduced, allowing direct interaction between users and individual agents. In this setup, agents can initiate conversations, continue the exchange until all necessary information is collected, and then effortlessly return to their tasks without disrupting the workflow.
